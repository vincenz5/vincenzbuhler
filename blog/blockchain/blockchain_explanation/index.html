    <h1>Blockchain Knowledge</h1>

    <p>"Nah man, we're not strangers."</p>
    <p>"I want curated and targeted knowledge from my bro haha"</p>

    <p>Okay, here you go:</p>

    <p>A blockchain is based on a set of rules that enforce an accounting system accounting for balances, like on Bitcoin, plus
        states, like on Ethereum. The system of rules are designed in a method that follows game theory (actually mechanism
        design but that's not common knowledge).</p>

    <p>The rules set forth by the protocol of a blockchain are intended to both coordinate the verifyers of new sets of data
        (miners) but also pit them up against each other so they cannot make up data. If they could make up data, they could
        increase the balance of their own wallets or decrease those of others.</p>

    <p>What this specifically solves is problems like double spending and lack of transparency. Since transactions cannot be
        falsified and the blockchain ledger (the data showing all transactions and balances, plus contract code like in virtual
        machines) is shared among anyone with a running node, it makes for a form of governance of accounting that anyone
        can rely on without trusting the intentions or abilities of third parties. This compares to the existing methods
        of the financial system where balances and accounting of the monetary system and debts are held on private ledgers,
        on corporate and government servers, and transfers are based on faith of the institutionns involved.</p>

    <h4>Bitcoin really has two functions:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>The first, and certainly best know: accounting of balances of the native currency, Bitcoin, in people's wallets.
            Wallets are tracked through their wallet addresses, hexidecimal (0 through 9 and a through f) lines (public keys)
            26 to 35 characters long. These addresses are controlled by whoever (or whatever) inputs the private key (64
            characters long). Something like: E9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262</li>
        <br>
        <li>The much less known: simple escrow between public addresses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Ethereum introduces new functions:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Smart contracts that can be encoded through the use of Solidity, and compiled into bytecode to run on the Ethereum
            Virtual Machine that is verified by Ethereum miners. These contracts are self enforcing, which means they can
            follow their own encoded commands based on the predetermined rules programmed into them by their authors.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Escrow contracts that can include functions like time or conditional lockup.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Roles and permissions can be set in immutable code on these contracts, allowing for reduction in corruption and improved
            tools for transparency of governance.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Tradable or non tradable tokens that are transferable between addresses with the permission of the governing smart
            contract.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>State channels: contracts that govern the transaction between at least two addresses. These can be used to govern
            payments or other forms of state. These channel contracts can be encoded to accept off-chain messages that are
            signed by the private keys of the addresses involved in the transaction and enforcement of payments, for example,
            can be enforced through collateral locked up by the smart contract and only released according to the rules encoded
            in the contract. This allows for multiple parties to interact without having the iniate and wait for on-chain
            transactions every time while still relying on self enforcement of smart contracts and the immutability of a
            blockchain.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Coordination of voting and exection of governance mandates set by decentralized organizations of people and entities.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Decentralization of exchanges and methods of price discovery. For example, one can set up a blind auction model where
            players can read the Solidity code regulating the auction but cannot see what everyone else is offering during
            the auction. Also, a contract exchange can be set up to hold tokens or Ether in escrow during trades.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Trustless operation of opening and closing of sidechains, where parties can enter and leave by staking something
            in a contract on the mainchain to enter into the sidechain but verification of transactions and other changes
            of state or storage on the sidechain is verified according to the specific rules of that sidechain. For example,
            xDai is a sidechain where Dai tokens from the mainchain can be employed on the sidechain, with a proof of authority
            protocol (reduced security) but almost instant transactions at almost no cost.</li>
    </ul>
